                CiteAs is a way to
                 get the correct citation for diverse research products including,
                software, datasets, preprints, and traditional articles. By making it easier
                to cite software and other "alternative" scholarly products, we aim to help
                the creators of such products get full credit for their work.

                CiteAs is a small part of <a href="http://blog.impactstory.org/collaborating-635k-grant-improve-credit-research-software/">
                    a collaborative grant
                </a> we're doing with
                <a href="http://james.howison.name/">James Howison</a> at the
                University of Texas-Austin. Funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation,
                the focus of this grant is to create a big database of research software, automatically extracted
                from millions of open-access scholarly articles using machine-learning techniques.
                Along with the database, we'll also make three small prototype applications to show
                off how the data can be used in cool ways. CiteAs is one of these applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're still working on creating the database. But while that's in progress,
                we thought it'd be cool to release CiteAs, even though it still is missing the majority
                of data it will ultimately use. Feel free to kick the tires, and let us know what you think!
            </p>

            <p>
                And stay tuned! We'll be building the database in 2018, and expect to have that data live in
                CiteAs by 2019.
            </p>
