                The CiteAs API powers this website, and is also available for
                use in your own projects. Soon we'll have documentation for the API
                here.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the meantime, though, feel free to play around with it. There's just one main endpoint, which
                gets citation information for a project given a DOI or URL. Here's
                an example:
            </p>
            <code>
                <a href="http://api.citeas.org/product/http://yt-project.org">
                    http://api.citeas.org/product/http://yt-project.org
                </a>
            </code>

            <p>
                The returned data is pretty self-documenting,
                but feel free to drop us a line if you run into any trouble. We'll have more
                docs up here before too long. Happy coding!
            </p>
